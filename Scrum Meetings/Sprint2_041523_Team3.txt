Minutes from Previous Meeting
In the last meeting we finished testing and implementation of OAuth 2.0. We talked about getting the manager backend worked on and having Max get started on the front end for the manager view. Yvan had started creating the customer front end support. We discussed our progress on MVP for Sprint 2 and gauging where we were. We discussed Devon’s technology issues since his laptop broke and how to get Max’s IDEs up and running so he can work on the front end.
