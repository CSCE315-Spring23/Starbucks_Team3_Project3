Minutes from Previous Meeting
During the last meeting we talked about what options we had for this new project in terms of frameworks. We considered both NODE.JS and FLASK and decided to use FLASK for our back end since the majority of the team does not have JavaScript experience. We talked about the best front end to pair with FLASK and we determined that REACT would be the best option. We discussed everyoneâ€™s roles and who would work on front end, back end, and team lead. We decided we would stick with the same roles as project 2 where Sam and David are back end, Yvan and Max on front end, and Devon as the team leader. We ended the meeting by having everyone look into REACT and FLASK and installing it.
