Minutes For Previous Meeting:

In our last meeting we talked about our tasks and issues we were facing with refactoring our project. We discussed what we wanted to refactor for our sprint 1 MVP. We decided we wanted to work on getting backend and frontend to work together for example being able to display database information on the front end. We also wanted to set up basic back end functionality and have some front end views ready for our MVP. We helped each other with errors we had when setting up our new framework.
