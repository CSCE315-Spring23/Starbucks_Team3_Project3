Minutes from Previous Meeting

Last talked about are MVP for Sprint 1. We decided we will have a basic server view ready for the MVP that lets a person create and process an order. We then talked about Google OAuth. OAuth was almost ready and needed to be finished up and tested. For the start of Sprint 2 we wanted to finish what we planned on finishing for Sprint 1 which we did. We finally finished discussing Sprint 2 and our goal. We intend to create a functioning manager view for Sprint 2 and complete two APIs (Google Translate & OAuth).
