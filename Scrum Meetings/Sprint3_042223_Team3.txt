Minutes from Previous Meeting
In the last meeting we talked about getting our Sprint 2 MVP completed. We realized we were not where we wanted to be at the time. Didnâ€™t have everything we wanted to have for this MVP. Talked about the manager front end being non-existent, and talked about issues the team was having getting this stuff done. We talked about getting the Manager View front end done as soon as possible before the next meeting and finishing weather API, and continuing to improve customer and server front ends.
