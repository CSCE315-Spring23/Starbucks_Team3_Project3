Minutes from Previous Meeting
In the last meeting we talked about how we have to get the front end for the manager done, and how the order processing isnt working fully. We talked about the final things we had to complete and we went through the project requirements making sure we werenâ€™t missing anything that is required. We discussed that we will probably have to put in a lot of time outside of the class to finish up the project over the weekend on Monday and Tuesday.
