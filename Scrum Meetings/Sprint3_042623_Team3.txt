Minutes from Previous Meeting
Last meeting we were discussing how behind we were as a group. We were stressed that we didnâ€™t have a front end for the manager view though we do have the  backend ready. We talked about the need for a menu board since that was not done and talked about implementing accessibility features that were required. We also discussed ways to make our server and customer front ends look better.
